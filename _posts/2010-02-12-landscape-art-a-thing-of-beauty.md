Just got sent a link for Matthew Albanese's portfolio. He works with various materials to reproduce natural large scale landscapes in miniature models. Very nice techniques, take a look at his <a href="http://www.behance.net/MatthewAlbanese/frame/366923">portfolio</a>.

Its definitely painstaking and takes a lot of patience. He also shows how he accomplishes it <a href="http://www.behance.net/MatthewAlbanese/frame/407705">here</a>.
