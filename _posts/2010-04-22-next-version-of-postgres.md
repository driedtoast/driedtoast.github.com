<p>Looks like the creator of postgres started up an new database called <a href="http://www.voltdb.com/">voltdb</a>. Its based on the concepts from the <a href="http://db.cs.yale.edu/hstore/">MIT/Yale H-Store</a>.</p>
<p>Its still pretty early yet to see how this will shape out, but definitely something to watch in the db space.</p>
