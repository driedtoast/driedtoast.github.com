<p>Just ran across <a href="http://www.diagrammr.com/">diagrammr</a> today. Its quite interesting. You describe the components in an architecture or some sort of relationships and it takes the first and last words as the components and draws a line between them.</p>
<p>So for instance, you write:</p>
<p>`loadbalancer routes to webserver`</p>
<p>andÂ </p>
<p>`webserver routes to appserver`</p>
<p>There will be 3 boxes, one for loadbalancer, one for webserver and one for the appserver. There will also be lines connecting the 2 of them. I've decided to start to use this for quick diagramming of architectural concepts. Beats drawing lines yourself, give it a try.</p>
