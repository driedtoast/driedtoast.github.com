<p>The <a href="http://www.amplesdk.com/">amplesdk</a>Â is very interesting idea that you can use all javascript and markup languages to provide a RIA feel to a web application. This could be used nicely with the new spring 3.0 REST annotations if you want to just serve pages that react to xul, json, etc... via javascript interpretation.</p>
<p>The ample sdk could be used as a replacement / augmentation of a flex front-end. The approach for each is pretty much the same in relation to the backend application architecture.</p>
